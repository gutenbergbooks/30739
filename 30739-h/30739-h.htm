<h2>MR. PUNCH'S MORAL MUSIC-HALL DRAMAS.</h2>

<h4>No. IX.&mdash;UNDER THE HARROW.</h4>

<center><i>A Conventional Comedy-Melodrama, in two Acts.</i><br /><br />

<span class="smcap">Characters.</span></center>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Sir Poshbury Puddock</span> (<i>a haughty and high-minded Baronet</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Verbena Puddock</span> (<i>his Daughter</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Bleshugh</span> (<i>her Lover</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Spiker</span> (<i>a needy and unscrupulous Adventurer</i>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Blethers</span> (<i>an ancient and attached Domestic</i>).</p></blockquote>

<p>ACT I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>The Morning Room, at Natterjack Hall, Toadley-le-Hole;
large window open at back, with heavy practicable sash.</i></p>

<center><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Blethers</span>.</center>

<p><i>Blethers.</i> Sir <span class="smcap">Poshbury's</span> birthday to-day&mdash;his birthday!&mdash;and the
gentry giving of him presents. Oh, Lor! if they only knew what <i>I</i> could
tell 'em!... Ah, and <i>must</i> tell, too, before long&mdash;but not yet&mdash;not
yet!</p>

<p class="regards">[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<center><i>Enter</i> Lord <span class="smcap">Bleshugh</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Verbena</span>.</center>

<p><i>Verb.</i> Yes, Papa is forty to-day; (<i>innocently</i>) fancy living to <i>that</i>
age! The tenants have presented him with a handsome jar of mixed
pickles, with an appropriate inscription. Papa is loved and respected by
every one. And I&mdash;well, I have made him a little housewife, containing
needles and thread.... See!</p>

<p class="regards">[<i>Shows it.</i></p>

<p><i>Lord Blesh. (tenderly).</i> I say, I&mdash;I wish you would make <i>me</i> a little
housewife!</p>

<p class="regards">[<i>Comedy love-dialogue omitted owing to want of space.</i></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 30%">
<a href="images/145.png">
<img src="images/145.png" width="100%" alt="cartoon" /></a>
</div>

<p><i>Verb.</i> Oh, do look!&mdash;there's Papa crossing the lawn with, oh, such a
horrid man following him!</p>

<p><i>Lord B.</i> Regular bounder. Shocking bad hat!</p>

<p><i>Verb.</i> Not so bad as his boots, and <i>they</i> are not so bad as his face!
Why doesn't Papa order him to go away? Oh, he is actually inviting him
in!</p>

<center><i>Enter</i> Sir <span class="smcap">Poshbury</span>, <i>gloomy and constrained, with</i> <span class="smcap">Spiker</span>, <i>who is
jaunty, and somewhat over-familiar</i>.</center>

<p><i>Spiker (sitting on the piano, and dusting his boots with a
handkerchief).</i> Cosy little shanty you've got here, <span class="smcap">Puddock</span>&mdash;very tasty!</p>

<p><i>Sir P. (with a gulp).</i> I am&mdash;ha&mdash;delighted that you approve of it! Ah,
<span class="smcap">Verbena</span>!</p>

<p class="regards">[<i>Kisses her on forehead.</i></p>

<p><i>Spiker.</i> Your daughter, eh? Pooty gal. Introduce me.</p>

<p class="regards">[<i>Sir</i> <span class="smcap">Posh</span>. <i>introduces him&mdash;with an effort</i>.</p>

<p><i>Verbena. (coldly).</i> How do you do? Papa, did you know that the sashline
of this window was broken? If it is not mended, it will fall on
somebody's head, and perhaps kill him!</p>

<p><i>Sir. P. (absently).</i> Yes&mdash;yes, it shall be attended to; but leave us,
my child, go. <span class="smcap">Bleshugh</span>, this&mdash;er&mdash;gentleman and I have business of
importance to discuss.</p>

<p><i>Spiker.</i> Don't let us drive you away, Miss; your Pa and me are only
talking over old times, that's all&mdash;eh, <span class="smcap">Posh</span>?</p>

<p><i>Sir P. (in a tortured aside).</i> Have a care, Sir, don't drive me too
far! (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Verb.</span>) Leave us, I say. (Lord <span class="smcap">B.</span> and <span class="smcap">Verb.</span> <i>go out, raising
their eyebrows</i>.) Now, Sir, what is this secret you profess to have
discovered?</p>

<p><i>Spiker.</i> Oh, a mere nothing. (<i>Takes out a cigar.</i>) Got a light about
you? Thanks. Perhaps you don't recollect twenty-seven years ago this
very day, travelling from Edgware Road to Baker Street, by the
Underground Railway?</p>

<p><i>Sir P.</i> Perfectly; it was my thirteenth birthday, and I celebrated the
event by a visit to Madame <span class="smcap">Tussaud's</span>.</p>

<p><i>Spiker.</i> Exactly; it was your thirteenth birthday, and you travelled
second-class with a half-ticket&mdash;(<i>meaningly</i>)&mdash;on your thirteenth
birthday.</p>

<p><i>Sir P. (terribly agitated).</i> Fiend that you are, how came you to learn
this?</p>

<p><i>Spiker.</i> Very simple. I was at that time in the temporary position of
ticket-collector at Baker Street. In the exuberance of boyhood, you
cheeked me. I swore to be even with you some day.</p>

<p><i>Sir P.</i> Even if&mdash;if your accusation were well-founded, how are you
going to prove it?</p>

<p><i>Sp.</i> Oh, that's easy! I preserved the half-ticket, on the chance that I
should require it as evidence hereafter.</p>

<p><i>Sir P. (aside).</i> And so the one error of an otherwise blameless boyhood
has found me out&mdash;at last. (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Spiker</span>.) I fear you not; my crime&mdash;if
crime indeed it was&mdash;is surely condoned by twenty-seven long years of
unimpeachable integrity!</p>

<p><i>Sp.</i> Bye-laws are bye-laws, old buck! there's no time limit in criminal
offences that ever <i>I</i> heard of! Nothing can alter the fact that you,
being turned thirteen, obtained a half-ticket by a false representation
that you were under age. A line from me, even now, denouncing you to the
Traffic Superintendent, and I'm very much afraid&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir P. (writhing).</i> <span class="smcap">Spiker</span>, my&mdash;my dear friend, you won't do that&mdash;you
won't expose me? Think of my age, my position, my daughter!</p>

<p><i>Sp.</i> Ah, now you've touched the right chord! I <i>was</i> thinking of your
daughter&mdash;a nice lady-like gal&mdash;I don't mind telling you she fetched me,
Sir, at the first glance. Give me her hand, and I burn the compromising
half-ticket before your eyes on our return from church after the
wedding. Come, that's a fair offer!</p>

<p><i>Sir P. (indignantly).</i> My child, the ripening apple of my failing eye,
to be sacrificed to a blackmailing blackguard like you! Never while I
live!</p>

<p><i>Sp.</i> Just as you please; and, if you will kindly oblige me with writing
materials, I will just drop a line to the Traffic Superintendent&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir P. (hoarsely).</i> No, no; not <i>that</i>.... Wait, listen; I&mdash;I will
speak to my daughter. I promise nothing; but if her heart is still her
own to give, she may (mind, I do not say she <i>will</i>) be induced to link
her lot to yours, though I shall not attempt to influence her in any
way&mdash;in <i>any</i> way.</p>

<p><i>Sp.</i> Well, you know your own business best, old Cockalorum. Here comes
the young lady, so I'll leave you to manage this delicate affair alone.
Ta-ta. I shan't be far off.</p>

<p class="regards">[<i>Swaggers insolently out as</i> <span class="smcap">Verb.</span> <i>enters</i>.</p>

<p><i>Sir P.</i> My child, I have just received an offer for your hand. I know
not if you will consent?</p>

<p><i>Verb.</i> I can guess who has made that offer, and why. I consent with all
my heart, dear Papa.</p>

<p><i>Sir P.</i> Can I trust my ears! You consent? Noble girl!</p>

<p class="regards">[<i>He embraces her.</i></p>

<p><i>Verb.</i> I was quite sure dear <span class="smcap">Bleshugh</span> meant to speak, and I <i>do</i> love
him very much.</p>

<p><i>Sir P. (starting).</i> It is not Lord <span class="smcap">Bleshugh</span>, my child, but Mr. <span class="smcap">Samuel
Spiker</span>, the gentleman (for he is at heart a gentleman) whom I introduced
to you just now.</p>

<p><i>Verb.</i> I have seen so little of him, Papa, I cannot love him&mdash;you must
really excuse me!</p>

<p><i>Sir P.</i> Ah, but you will, my darling, you <i>will</i>&mdash;I know your unselfish
nature&mdash;you will, to save your poor old dad from a terrible disgrace ...
yes, <i>disgrace</i>, listen! Twenty-seven years ago&mdash;(<i>he tells her all</i>).
<span class="smcap">Verbena</span>, at this very moment, there is a subscription on foot in the
county to present me with my photograph, done by an itinerant
photographer of the highest eminence, and framed and glazed ready for
hanging. Is that photograph never to know the nail which even now awaits
it? Can you not surrender a passing girlish fancy, to spare your fond
old father's fame? Mr. <span class="smcap">Spiker</span> is peculiar, perhaps, in many ways&mdash;not
quite of our <i>monde</i>&mdash;but he loves you sincerely, my child, and that is,
in itself, a recommendation. Ah, I see&mdash;my prayers are vain ... be
happy, then. As for me, let the police come&mdash;I am ready!</p>

<p class="regards">[<i>Weeps.</i></p>

<p><i>Verb.</i> Not so, Papa; I will marry this Mr. <span class="smcap">Spiker</span>, since it is your
wish.</p>

<p class="regards">[Sir <span class="smcap">Posh.</span> <i>dries his eyes</i>.</p>

<p><i>Sir P.</i> Here, <span class="smcap">Spiker</span>, my dear fellow, it is all right. Come in. She
accepts you.</p>

<center><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Spiker</span>.</center>

<p><i>Sp.</i> Thought she would. Sensible little gal! Well, Miss, you shan't
regret it. Bless you, we'll be as chummy together as a couple of little
dicky-birds!</p>

<p><i>Verb.</i> Mr. <span class="smcap">Spiker</span>, let us understand one another. I will do my best to
be a good wife to you&mdash;but chumminess is not mine to give, nor can I
promise ever to be your dicky-bird.</p>

<center><i>Enter</i> Lord <span class="smcap">Bleshugh</span>.</center>

<p><i>Lord B.</i> Sir <span class="smcap">Poshbury</span>, may I have five minutes with you? <span class="smcap">Verbena</span>, you
need not go. (<i>Looking at</i> <span class="smcap">Spiker</span>.) Perhaps this person will kindly
relieve us of his presence.</p>

<p><i>Sp.</i> Sorry to disoblige, old feller, but I'm on duty where Miss <span class="smcap">Verbena</span>
is now, you see, as she's just promised to be my wife.</p>

<p><i>Lord B.</i> <i>Your</i> wife!</p>

<p><i>Verb. (faintly).</i> Yes, Lord <span class="smcap">Bleshugh</span>, his <i>wife</i>!</p>

<p><i>Sir P.</i> Yes, my poor boy, <i>his</i> wife!</p>

<blockquote>[<span class="smcap">Verbena</span> <i>totters, and falls heavily in a dead faint</i>, <span class="smcap">R.C.</span>, <i>upsetting
a flower-stand</i>; Lord <span class="smcap">Bleshugh</span> <i>staggers, and swoons on sofa</i>, <span class="smcap">C.</span>,
<i>overturning a table of knicknacks</i>; Sir <span class="smcap">Poshbury</span> <i>sinks into chair</i>,
<span class="smcap">L.C.</span>, <i>and covers his face with his hands</i>.</blockquote>

<p><i>Sp. (looking down on them triumphantly).</i> Under the Harrow, by Gad!
Under the Harrow!</p>

<h2>MODERN TYPES.</h2>

<center>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Own Type-Writer.</i>)<br />

No. VI.&mdash;THE POLITICAL WOMAN.</center>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Political Woman is one upon whom, if she may be believed, the world
has never smiled. She avenges herself by recounting her wrongs and those
of her sex to all who can be induced to listen to her. In early youth
she will have taught herself by a superficial study of political history
that all great movements have depended for their success upon Women, and
that men, though they may ride on the whirlwind have had but little hand
in directing the storm. The base ingratitude which has hitherto attended
feminine effort in general, has aroused in her breast a quite particular
and personal resentment against all men who have the misfortune to
disagree with her. Hence it comes that the males who bask in the
sunshine of her approval are but few. It is noticeable, that although
she openly despises men, she makes herself, and wishes to make her
fellow women as masculine as is compatible with the wearing of
petticoats, and the cultivation of habitual inaccuracy of mind.
Moreover, although she has a fine contempt, of which she makes no
concealment, for most women, she selects as the associates of her
political enterprises and her daily life, only those men whose cast of
mind would suit better with the wearing of gowns than of trousers.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 25%">
<a href="images/148b.png">
<img src="images/148b.png" width="100%" alt="cartoon" /></a>
</div>

<p>The Political Woman is far removed from the ordinary members of Primrose
Leagues and Women's Federations, with whom the country abounds. Her
over-mastering political appetite would find no satisfaction in the mere
wearing of badges, the distribution of blankets, the passing of
common-place resolutions, or the fearful joy of knowing a secret
password and countersign. Such trifles are, in her opinion, mere whets
for the political banquet. For herself she requires far stronger meat.
From the fact, that the race of women is in physical energy inferior to
that of men, she has apparently deduced as an axiom, that nature
intended them to be equal in every respect. Few women agree with her,
fewer still show any desire for the supposed boons to the attainment of
which she is constantly urging them. Yet, the knowledge of these facts
only seems to render the Political Woman more determined in the
prosecution of her quest, and more bitter in her attacks upon men.</p>

<p>At school the Political Woman will have been highly thought of as a
writer of vigorous essays, in which unconventional opinions were
expressed, in ungrammatical language. She will have formed a Debating
Society amongst her fellow-pupils, and, having caused herself to be
elected perpetual President, she will leave the Presidential arm-chair
at the beginning of every debate, in order to demolish by anticipation
all who may venture to speak after her. She will play various kinds of
music upon the piano with a uniform vigour that would serve well for the
beating of carpets, and will express much scorn for the feeble beings
who use the soft pedal, or indulge in the luxury of a "touch."</p>

<p>Having left school with an ill-assorted mass of miscellaneous knowledge,
she will show her contempt for ordinary feminine accomplishments by
refusing to attend dances, and by crushing mild young men whom
misfortune may have thrown in her way. Having discovered from one of
these that he imagines the Rebecca Riots to be an incident of Old
Testament History, and has no definite views upon the currency question,
she will observe, in a tone of some bitterness, that "These are our
Governors!" and, having left him in a state of collapse, will scale the
ramparts of political discussion, in company with a Professor, who
happens to be unmarried and a Member of Parliament. After making love
for some months, by means of an interchange of political tracts, these
two will be married in a registrar's office, and will spend their
honeymoon in investigating the social requirements of Italian
organ-grinders.</p>

<p>From this moment she exists chiefly as a Member or President of
innumerable Committees. No sooner does the shadow of a political idea
flit through her brain, than she forms a Committee to promote its
development. When not engaged in forming or in sitting upon Committees,
she occupies herself in delivering lectures "to Women only," or in
discussing the Woman's Suffrage question with the Member of Parliament
for her district (whom she despises) by means of letters, which she
subsequently publishes in the journal of which she is, by this time, the
proprietor, editor, and staff combined.</p>

<p>In a regrettable moment of absent-mindedness she bore to the Professor a
son, whom she brings up on Spartan principles, and little else. Her home
is a centre of slatternly discomfort. She rises early, but, having
locked herself into her study, for the better composition of a discourse
on "The Sacred Right of Revolt for Women," she forgets that both the tea
and the coffee are locked in with her, and learns subsequently with
surprise, but without regret, that her husband drank water to his
breakfast. She then proceeds to regenerate the working-man, by proving
to him, that his wife is a miserable creature for submitting to his
sway, and rouses an audience of spectacled enthusiasts to frenzy by
proclaiming, that she is ready to lead them to the tented field for the
assertion of rights which the malignity of men has filched from them.
Later on, she presides over her various Committees, and she returns home
to find that her child has burnt himself by falling on to the
dining-room fire, and that her cook has given warning.</p>

<p>She will eventually fail to be elected a member of the School Board, and
having written a strong book on a delicate social question, will die of
the shock of seeing it adversely reviewed in <i>The Spectator</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> great success which, in their own estimation, has attended the
endeavour to establish a series of Night Field Sports in the
neighbourhood of Melton Mowbray, so dashingly led off recently with a
regular across country Steeple Chase, "by lamplight," has, it is said,
induced the spirited organisers to extend their field of experiment; and
it is alleged that tennis, golf, hockey, and football are all to be
tried in turn, under the new conditions. That some excitement may be
reasonably looked for from the projected contests may be gathered from a
reference to the subjoined score, put on paper by the newly constituted
"Melton Mowbray Midnight Eleven," who, in a recent trial of strength
with a distinguished local Club, it will be seen, showed some capital,
if original play, in meeting their opponents in the national game,
conducted under what must have been necessarily somewhat novel and
unfamiliar conditions.</p>

<p>The boundaries of the field in which the wickets were pitched were
marked out with night-lights, the only other illumination being supplied
by a couple of moderator lamps, held respectively by the Umpire and
Square-leg. The costume, of course, comprised a night-shirt and a pair
of bed-room slippers, with which was also worn a pink
dressing-gown,&mdash;pink being the colour adopted by the Club. Owing to the
absence of any moon, and also to the fact that the night was a rather
boisterous one, on account of the persistency both of wind and rain, the
play suffered from some disadvantages. However, the Eleven went pluckily
to the wicket with the following result:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="scoreboard"><tr><td align= "left">Mr. <span class="smcap">George P-g-t</span>, mistaking, in the obscurity, the Umpire for
his wicket, gets out of his ground, and is instantly stumped out</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">Mr. <span class="smcap">Otto P-g-t</span> takes the Wicket-keeper's head for the ball,
and trying to "play it to leg," gives it in consequence such
a severe blow, that he is obliged to accompany the Wicket-keeper
in a cab to a hospital without finishing his innings</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">Mr. <span class="smcap">W. Ch-pl-n</span> treads on his wicket</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">Count <span class="smcap">Z-br-ski</span> makes 497 in one hit. The ball being, however,
only three yards off, but escaping notice, owing to the darkness,

find the wicket</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">Mr. <span class="smcap">E. H-n-age</span> trying a forward drive, but not able to see,
plays the whole of his wicket into the face of cover-point,whom he severely bruises, and is,
consequently, given out</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">Captain <span class="smcap">W-rn-r</span> takes the Long-stop for the Bowler; and, so
getting the wrong side of his wicket, is bowled out in his first over</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">Mr. <span class="smcap">McN-l</span> misled by the lights on the adjacent hedges, making
a hit, loses his way in trying a run; and finally, wandering

<tr><td align="left">Byes, &amp;c. </td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;704</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>2523</td></tr>
</table>

<p>At the conclusion of the innings, as daylight was beginning to break, it
was determined to draw the stumps, it being settled that play should be
resumed on the following midnight, when the opposing team were to take
their turn at the wicket.</p>

<h2>ROBERT ON THE BOAT-RACE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the moment as I rites on the most importentest ewent of the hopening
Spring, the warst majority of the four millions on us is a passing their
days and nites in wundering which blew side will win. Why they is both
blew, puzzles me. If so be as they was both saleing boats, in course I
coud unnerstand it, but, as they ain't, I gives up the puzzle, and gos
a-head.</p>

<p>By the by, <span class="smcap">Brown</span> has given me a strate tip, which I ginerously gives to
all my numerus readers. If it's a nice <i>light</i> day, Cambrige will
suttenly win; but if it's a dull, <i>dark</i> day, Hoxford will suttenly not
lose. So if any of my frends drops their money, it suttenly won't be my
fault.</p>

<p>I remember as one year we had 'em all to dinner at the Manshun House
after the Race, and werry remarkabel fine appytites they all seemed to
have, winners and loosers alike. I spose as Hoxford lost that time, and
most likely from the same cause. For I remembers as the Company werry
kindly drunk the elth of the man who pulled the ropes on that occasion,
and he was just sech another little feller as the won as lost last year,
and wen he returned thanks he sed werry wisely, I thort, as he shood
never pull the ropes again in a great match, for if your boat won nobody
didn't give you no praise for it, but if it lost, everybody said as it
was your fault.</p>

<p>I seed a good many of my respected Paytrons on that ocasion a injoying
of theirselves in their serveral ways. The <i>Maria Wood</i> state Barge was
there in all her glory, and plenty of gay company aboard, including
several members of the honoured Copperashun. In fack you ginerally sees
a fair number on 'em when there's anythink a going forred, whether of a
usefool or a hornymental caracter. One or two other wessels carried
their onered flag. But I looked in wane for any, the werry slightest,
simptom of the County Counsel of London having put in a appearance. Poor
Fellers, what with plenty of dull, dry hard work, and not a partikle of
rashnal injoyment, no not ewen such a trifle as a bit of free wittles or
a drop of free drink, what will they be looking like at the end of their
second year of hoffis? Why it's my beleef as their werry best frends
won' kno 'em. No wunder as they all wants to get free admissions to all
the Theaters and Music Alls. Rayther shabby idear for a full blown
County Counsellor, when a shilling will take him amost anywheres.</p>

<p>I thinks upon the hole as I prefers a Boat Race to an Horse Race. In the
fust place the grand excitement lasts much longer, in the nex place of
course their ain't no crewel whipping and spurring of the two gallant
Crews to make 'em go faster than possible, in the nex place their ain't
not no dust, and what a blessed loss that is I spose most on us knows by
his own blinded xperience, in the nex place there ain't but werry little
showting and borling and skreaming, and far beyond all, one is abel
direckly after the race is over, insted of rushing off to a scrowged
tent and paying 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for a bit of cold beef, werry Carelessly
served, to set down carmly and comfortably in one's littel cabbin, and

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<center>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</center>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, March 17.</i>&mdash;St. Patrick's Day in the evening.
Every Irish Member carries in buttonhole bit of withered grass; at least
looks like withered grass. <span class="smcap">Dick Power</span> says it's shamrock. Anyhow it
leads to dining-out, and business to fore being nothing more important
than voting a few millions sterling for the Navy, House almost empty.</p>

<p>"So much the better for me," says <span class="smcap">Georgie Hamilton</span>, in charge of Navy
Estimates; "the fewer Members the more Votes."</p>

<p>So it proved. Whilst <span class="smcap">Georgie</span> descanting on excellence of Naval
Administration, House so empty that Count moved. A little hard this on a
Minister in charge of most important department of State; but, after
all, Votes were the thing, and Votes were taken hand-over-hand.
<span class="smcap">Georgie's</span> oration being cut short by attempt to Count he sat down, and
as quick as Chairman could put question &pound;3,312,500 of our hard-earned
money was voted. Hadn't been in the House five minutes when bang went
another million. Only half-a-dozen of us present, including <span class="smcap">Wilson</span> of
Hull, who sat on edge of Bench, with hat in hand, staring at <span class="smcap">Courtney</span>,
as he ticked off million after million. For myself, as representing a
Constituency of the Gentlemen of England, grew rather to like it.
Something exhilarating in the consciousness that you, being one of eight
Members representing the House of Commons, can say "Aye" or "No" to
proposal to vote a million sterling more or less. "The question is,"
says <span class="smcap">Courtney</span>, "that a sum not exceeding &pound;1,103,200 be voted to <span class="smcap">Her
Majesty</span> on account of sums falling due for victualling, clothing and
Naval establishments. Those that are of that opinion, say 'Aye;'
contrary 'No.'"</p>

<p>Well, what shall you do? Pretty stiff sum; get a pretty lot of victuals
for the million; several suits of clothes for the &pound;103,000. Should you,
just to show your independence, knock off the odd &pound;200? No. Barks likes
the thing done generously. Why throw in a note of discord? Besides, it
doesn't all come out of your pocket. So you say "Aye;" <span class="smcap">Georgie Hamilton</span>
nods in grateful appreciation; <span class="smcap">Courtney</span> seems relieved; the thing's
done, and you walk out with a glowing consciousness of having behaved
handsomely.</p>

<p>Slight coolness sprung up between <span class="smcap">Old Morality</span> and <span class="smcap">Grandolph</span>. Of late
been on rather friendly terms, despite occasional kicking over of the
traces by <span class="smcap">Grandolph</span>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>"Boys will be boys," <span class="smcap">Old Morality</span> says, smiling genially on his young
friend. To-day little hitch arisen; <span class="smcap">Grandolph</span> has sent to papers text of
his Memorandum addressed to <span class="smcap">First Lord</span> of <span class="smcap">Treasury</span> in 1888, warning them
against appointing Special Commission. <span class="smcap">Grandolph</span>, having set forth with
masterly force his objections to scheme, winds up with remark:&mdash;"These
reflections have been sketched out concisely. <i>If submitted to a
Statesman</i>, many more, and much graver reflections, would probably be
suggested." <span class="smcap">Old Morality</span> hadn't noticed it before; but now words in
print stare him in face, doesn't like it. "'Submitted to a Statesman,'"
he murmured&mdash;"what does the fellow mean? Weren't they submitted to Me?"</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Voted money by hands-full.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;As a means of suffusing Treasury Bench with hearty,
unaffected hilarity, nothing so effective as a defeat in Division Lobby.
Noticed this twice of late. The other night, when <span class="smcap">Hamley's</span> Motion on
behalf of Volunteers was, <i>malgr&eacute; lui</i>, carried against the Government,
you'd have thought, to look on Treasury Bench, that some good news had
suddenly flashed upon them. <span class="smcap">Old Morality</span> beaming with smiles: <span class="smcap">Stanhope</span>
smirking; and even the countenance of <span class="smcap">Jokim</span> convulsively working with
what was understood to be signs of merriment. Same thing happened
to-night. <span class="smcap">Buchanan</span> brought forward Motion proposing to intrust to County
Councils duty of maintaining and protecting rights of way in Scotland.
Scotch Members united in support of popular demand, only <span class="smcap">Mark Stewart</span>
having his doubts. Even <span class="smcap">Finlay</span> made bold to hint Government would do
well to listen to demand. <span class="smcap">Chamberlain</span> openly and effectively declared on
behalf of Resolution; Government seemed to be in tight place; <span class="smcap">Old
Morality</span> moved uneasily in seat; still it would never do to interfere
with Dukes and others furtively or openly engaged in the task of closing
up paths over mountains, or shutting off walks by the lakes. Very
awkward and inconsiderate of <span class="smcap">Chamberlain</span> going off on this tack.</p>

<p>"Can't eat your cake and have it, you know," <span class="smcap">Old Morality</span> said,
unconsciously forming the words on his copy of the Orders in large
copy-book hand, "Mustn't play fast and loose with custodians of the
Union. Oughtn't to look back when you put your hand to the plough.
Should go the whole hog or none." These and other comforting phrases he
wrote out in best copper-plate, filling up time whilst House cleared for
Division. But when Tellers came back, and it was known that Resolution
was carried against Government, clouds passed away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Morality</span> tore up his copy-book headings, thrust hands in pockets;
assumed truculently jovial air; nearly died of laughing when <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>
announced figures showing Government had been defeated by 13. His
hilarity contagious. Mr. <span class="smcap">Biddulph</span> standing for a moment in the doorway
below the shadow of the Gallery, looked on, his face slowly broadening
into responsive smile.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "of all the rollicking dogs I ever came across, there
never was a pack to equal Her Majesty's Ministers in the hour of
defeat."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Buchanan's</span> Right of Way Motion carried against
Government by 110 against 97.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;"I like this quite quiet hour, <span class="smcap">Toby</span>," said the <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>, as
I sat on the Treasury Bench, he at Table, waiting for a quorum. "It
gives me opportunity of reading in <i>Freeman's Journal verbatim</i> reports
of speeches by <span class="smcap">Tanner</span>, <span class="smcap">Sheehy</span>, and <span class="smcap">William Redmond</span>. Heard them
delivered, of course; but there are some pleasures one likes to renew."</p>

<p>Should have begun business at twelve; now getting on for one. <span class="smcap">Albert
Rollit</span> in charge of Bankruptcy Bill with back to wall waiting for a
quorum. "Must see," he says, "if I can't frame Clause dealing specially
with Parliamentary proceedings. We shall shortly be bankrupt here if
this sort of thing goes on. Composition of four and a-half hours'
sitting on Wednesday afternoon scarcely enough to justify honourable
discharge."</p>

<p>Everything comes to man who waits. Quorum came for <span class="smcap">Rollit</span>. Numbers
increased as he proceeded with singularly lucid address, investing even
Bankruptcy with subtle charms. Gave the tone to thoroughly business
Debate; and, even in less than the maimed period of time allotted, had
carried his Bill through Second Reading.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Bankruptcy Bill read Second Time.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">John O'Connor</span> pervading House with profoundest mystery.
When Orders of Day called on, <span class="smcap">John</span> rose to his full height (6 foot 4 of
human kindness and geniality), and said, "Mr. <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>!" Motion was, that
House should go into Committee of Supply. According to New Rules,
<span class="smcap">Speaker</span> leaves Chair without putting Question; Question not put, obvious
no one could discuss it. But here was <span class="smcap">John</span> insisting on catching the
<span class="smcap">Speaker's</span> eye.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>!" he repeated, "I want to discuss some of the
irregularities of the Government."</p>

<p>But <span class="smcap">Speaker</span> had executed strategic retreat; Chair empty; <span class="smcap">John</span> standing
on tiptoe, followed retreating figure with despairing cry, "Mr.
<span class="smcap">Speaker</span>!" House half hoped <span class="smcap">Speaker</span> would return; dying with curiosity to
know what fresh irregularity on part of Government <span class="smcap">John</span> had discovered;
but no help for it. Chair empty; technically "No House;" and <span class="smcap">John</span>,
slowly subsiding, shutting up like a reluctant telescope, resumed seat.</p>

<p>Prince <span class="smcap">Arthur</span>, back from Golf at Eastbourne, looking better for his
holiday, lounged on Treasury Bench watching scene. "Alas!" he cried,
eyeing <span class="smcap">John</span> with dreamy glance, what time the fingers of his hand&mdash;a
strayed reveller&mdash;fitfully played with the rolled copy of his Orders, as
if it were his cherished Mandoline&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Alas for those who never sing,</p>
<p class="i0">But die with all their music in them."</p>
</div></div>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Vote on Account passed.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Lords had nice little "plant" on to-night. The <span class="smcap">Sage of Queen
Anne's Gate</span> got first place in other House for Motion decreeing their
abolition. "Such larks!" says the <span class="smcap">Markiss</span>; "let's get up big debate here
on House of Commons subject; draw away their men; leave <span class="smcap">Sage</span> in lurch."</p>

<p>So arranged Debate on Report of Parnell Commission for to-night. Full
dress affair; all the big guns to go off; Curiosity as to how they'd
treat too familiar subject. Plan answered admirably. Both shows running
together, Lords, as most novel entertainment, fuller spectacular
entertainment, drew the cake. Instead of crowded House that usually
waits when <span class="smcap">Sage</span> lunges at the Lords, beggarly array of empty Benches.
Rather depressing even for imperturbable <span class="smcap">Sage</span>. Little later, Members
finding things dull in Lords, came back in time to hear <span class="smcap">George Curzon</span>.
Capital speech; sparkle on the top; but some quiet depths of closely
reasoned argument below.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sage's</span> Motion for abolition of Lords negatived by 201
Votes against 139. Thus reprieved, Lords ordered Report of Parnell
Commission to be duly recorded.</p>

<h2>THE OLD BOND-STREET GALLERIES.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Why</span> they are called the Old Bond-Street Galleries, when there is so much
that is new to be seen there, it is impossible to say. Why not call it
the New Gallery? Perhaps those trusty Tudors&mdash;who are rather more than
two doors off&mdash;Messrs. <span class="smcap">Comyns Carr</span> and <span class="smcap">Hall&eacute;</span>, might object, and, even
then, only half the truth would be told. Let us ag-gravate them, and
call it the Ag-New Gallery at once! Unless it would be considered an
ag-rarian outrage, it would be impossible to give it a better ag-nomen.
Ha! ha! No matter what you call it, so long as you call and see the
collection of Water-colours. There is a vastly good "<i>Pygmalion and
Galatea</i>," by our own <span class="smcap">John Tenniel</span>; there are some tender Idyls, by
<span class="smcap">Frederick Walker</span>, a delicious "<i>Reverie</i>," by <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>, a delightful
"<i>Pet</i>," by <span class="smcap">E. K. Johnson</span>, wondrous Landscapes, by <span class="smcap">Birket Foster</span>, a
riverain poem, by <span class="smcap">C. J. Lewis</span>, and Dutch Symphonies, by <span class="smcap">Wilfrid Ball</span>.
Sir <span class="smcap">John Gilbert</span>, <span class="smcap">T. S. Cooper</span>, and <span class="smcap">F. Dicksee</span>, are well represented;
and among the earlier Water-colour Masters we may find such
distinguished names as <span class="smcap">J. M. W. Turner</span>, P. de <span class="smcap">Wint</span>, <span class="smcap">Copley Fielding</span>, and
<span class="smcap">David Cox</span>. There are lots of others, and, if you are left to browse amid
nearly three hundred excellent pictures, you ought to enjoy yourself
very much indeed, and find your mind so much improved when you come out,
that you will think it belongs to somebody else. In spite then of the
carping of <span class="smcap">Carr</span>, and the hallucinations of <span class="smcap">Hall&eacute;</span>, we declare this to be
the Ag-New Gallery.</p>

<hr />

<p>"<i><span class="smcap">La</span> Nona.</i>"&mdash;Is the new malady fact or fiction? Don't know, but anyhow
it's your "Grandmother."</p>
